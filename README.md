# Programming katas for beginners

Collection of programming exercises, so called katas, for beginners.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to get started.

2. Each folder is a separate kata. See the README attached to find kata specific instructions.

3. I recommend that you commit your solutions on a separate branch, e.g. `gabor-solution`. In this case, you can simply incorporate the updates from the remote repository to your branch  *master* without worrying of any merge conflicts.
